I took a new job semi recently, and have been learning a lot about some new to me technologies.  Right now a large part
of what I do revolves around nodejs.  I've pretty much fallen in love with the framework, and plan to update
[Ploutus](http://www.ploutus.com) to take advantage of it.

One of the perks of moving to nodejs is that I'll be able to move Ploutus away from my shared web hosting account.  I'm
not 100% sure on how I want to handle the account itself, but I know I haven't used it as much as I thought I would
since I started paying for it.  Also, being shared hosting it is pretty limited in what technologies it plays well with
(older versions of Rails and PHP being the big two).

If I can dump it completely I'd be a happy man.
