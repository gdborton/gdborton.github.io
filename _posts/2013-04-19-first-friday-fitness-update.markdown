I've been working on my [get sexy goal](http://www.garyborton.com/2013/04/16/get-sexy/) for a little of a week now, and
so far I've made some outstanding progress.  I'm going to attempt to do an end of the week rehash on my progress, what I
feel I did right, and what I feel I could do better.

## Progress

![Burn Down Chart](/images/progress_graphic.png "First week's weight loss progress.")

There is a tiny bit of weight loss that happened before I started recording my progress, but for the sake of clean data
I'm going to ignore it.  The three lines represent a linear progression from my starting weight (213.5 lbs) to my goal
weight (190 lbs), my current weight, and the weight my Calorie intake says I should be at (based on some quick math I
outlined [here](http://www.garyborton.com/2013/04/17/losing-weight-by-the-numbers/)).

There are several reasons why it appears that I'm ahead of the game.  The first is inaccuracyâ€¦ your body weight can
fluctuate day to day and even hour to hour.

Your weight can also drop pretty quickly when you first start working out and dieting.  Less food intake at the start
doesn't mean that your already a few pounds lighter, but it could mean that you have less food in your stomach waiting
to be digested and expelled.

I think that the primary reason that my progress has been faster than expected is that I was very conservative in my
estimates, and I didn't account for my calories burned working out.  When I calculated my maintenance Calories, I used a
sedentary calculation instead of an active one.  The only reason I did this was because I really enjoy being ahead of my
plan, and might burn out if I were ever behind.

## Workout

For this first week, I tried to ease into my workouts a bit. I tried to be sure that I wasn't going to be overly sore,
too much so to go back to the gym.  My basic routine was a half mile walk/jog, lifting for two different body groups,
and finally a half mile walk/jog cool down.

For my lifting portion, I went everyday except Sunday.  Monday was chest/biceps, Tuesday was back/triceps, Wednesday was
legs/shoulders, and then started over for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  I tried to get in three different exercises,
with three sets each, for each body part.

Next week I plan on starting [Max-OT](http://www.ast-ss.com/maxot.php) from AST Sports Science, so look for some workout
logs next update.

## Where I Need Improvement

Overall I think I did well.  I do think that I need to get more protein, which sadly will need to come from protein
powder (anyone that says they like the taste is lying).  I should have another post soon on why.

Saturday was the only real time that I faltered from my plan.  I went out with some friends, and had planned on having
one turkey burger (low carb, from Hardee's, and amazing), and enough calories left over for a few drinks.

I ended up eating two burgers, because drinking my protein shakes on an empty stomach was killing me.  Also, I was up
super late and ended up downing half the bottle of vodka that I got.
