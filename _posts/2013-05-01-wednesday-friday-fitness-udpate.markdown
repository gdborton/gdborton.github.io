This is embarrassingly late, by almost a week.  I've got a few things going on at the moment that detracted from my time
to put toward this.  The most important being that we're painting a good portion of our house, and we needed to get it
done before we have carpet installed tomorrow.

Any who, time for some numbers.

## Progress

Second week's weight loss progress.
Moar Progress!
Look at that, down another three pounds in just a week.  I'm not sure what amount of this weight is water and/or daily
fluctuation, but when the scale tells me I lost I'm happy.

## Workout

This will be moving to its own post, will have it up soon enough.

## Where I need improvement

I did pretty well this weak in that I didn't drink half a bottle of vodka in one night, but I did go out twice.  I tried
to keep my intake small by ordering smaller items from the menu and avoiding my usually Cherry Coke, but the amount of
Calories in even the small dishes is kind of frightening.  I makes me wonder how many Calories I was eating before I
started watching my intake, if I had to guess I'd put the number around 4-5000.
